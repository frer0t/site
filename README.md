# My Portfolio Website

Welcome to my portfolio website! I built this using **React**, **Vite**, **Framer Motion**, **Tailwind CSS**, **React Icons**, and components from **Aceternity UI** to showcase my projects, skills, and contact details in a modern and engaging way.

## Features

- **React with Vite**: Super fast and efficient build setup.
- **Framer Motion**: Smooth animations that make the site feel alive.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for designing quickly and easily.
- **Aceternity UI**: Ready-to-use components for a polished design.
- **React Icons**: Beautiful and customizable icons for enhancing UI.
- **Dark Mode and Light Mode Support**: Seamlessly switch between light and dark themes for a personalized experience.
- **Responsive Design**: Looks great on desktops, tablets, and phones.

## Demo

Check out the live site [frerot.dev](https://frerot.dev).

## Installation

Here’s how you can run the site on your own machine:

1. **Clone the repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iamfrerot/portfolio.git
   ```

2. **Go to the project folder:**
   ```bash
   cd portfolio
   ```

3. **Install the dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Open the site in your browser:**
   Head over to `http://localhost:3000`.

## How to Use

- Update the **projects** section with your own work by editing `src/utils/data.ts` (or wherever the project data lives).
- Customize styles and components in the `src/ui/` and `src/Components/` folders.
- Tweak animations using `Framer Motion` in the relevant components.
- Utilize **Aceternity UI** components for adding or modifying UI elements.
- Add icons using **React Icons** by importing them from the library and integrating them into your components.
- Switch between dark and light modes using the built-in theme toggle functionality.

## Technologies I Used

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Vite**: For faster development and builds.
- **Framer Motion**: To add animations.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling, including dark mode support.
- **Aceternity UI**: For pre-designed, high-quality UI components.
- **React Icons**: For easily integrating scalable icons.


## Deployment

Here’s how I deploy the site:

1. **Build the project:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy to hosting platforms** like Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages:
   - For **Vercel**, I push the repo to GitHub and import it into Vercel.
