## the what & why

[![website Screenshot](public/og.png)](https://frerot.dev) hey there! this is my
digital playground where i show off cool stuff i've made, talk about what i
know, and share my professional journey. think of it as my little home on the
internet where you can learn all about me and my work!

some neat features:

- super sleek design that looks awesome on any screen size üì±üíª
- a showcase of my digital creations in the wild üöÄ
- random thoughts and tech ramblings in blog üí≠

i built this with all the modern web goodies to make sure it's zippy fast and
smooth as butter. i pop in regularly to add my latest projects and brain dumps!

## how to kick things off

want to run this site on your own computer? follow these steps and you'll be up
and running in no time! üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüí®

### stuff you'll need first

before we dive in, make sure you've got these things installed:

- npm (the package wrangler)
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```
- node (either using nvm - the cool way)
  ```sh
  nvm install 18.17.0 # or whatever version floats your boat
  ```
  or grab it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) like a normal
  person

### setting up the fun

_follow these magical incantations to summon a local version of my website:_

1. snag a copy of my code

```sh
git clone https://github.com/iamfrerot/site.git
```

2. jump into the project folder

```sh
cd site
```

3. install all the digital ingredients

```sh
npm install
# or if you're fancy
yarn install
# or if you're extra fancy
pnpm install
```

4. create a secret spell book (`.env.local`) with these magic words

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_URL=http://localhost:3000
RESEND_KEY=your_resend_api_key
RESEND_AUDIENCE_ID=your_audience_id
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=my@custom.domain
```

5. start the engines!

```sh
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

6. point your browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and
   voil√†! ‚ú®

congrats! you've got my website running on your very own computer. how cool is
that?
